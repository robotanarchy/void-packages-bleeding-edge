# Format:
# package-name type source-url [subfolder_for_checkout]
#
# You can specify multiple repositories per package-name, if you have to.
# The version will get extracted from the first repo listed for a package.
# Keep in mind, that git submodules are also supported.
#
# The void-packages line must always be there.
#
# You don't need to add a repository for every custom package - only if you
# want to build the latest version and automatically update the template
# version number.
